      <p>
        Global.Church is a FaithTech project born from a simple but powerful idea: what if the global Church could share data seamlessly? Our mission is to break down the technical barriers that isolate church communities, empowering developers, ministries, and individuals to build a more connected ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a team of volunteer developers, designers, and data specialists united by a common vision. By creating and maintaining an open-source schema and a free-to-use API, we provide the foundational infrastructure for the next generation of FaithTech applications. Whether it&#39;s helping someone find a new church home, enabling ministries to coordinate efforts, or providing researchers with valuable insights, our work is about creating tools that serve.
